The purpose of this project is to create a functional calculator.

There are 8 function in our library: add, subtract, multiply, divide, factorial, GDC, LCM and Random.

In order to use the library, first, include both the .h and .cpp file. Then, create a calculator object. You can use this object to call different functions via the dot operator.

add, subtract, multiply and divide functions require two arguments of type 'double'.
LCM and GCD functions require two arguments of type 'long long'.
factorial function requires one argument of type 'long long'.
Random function does not require any arguments.
